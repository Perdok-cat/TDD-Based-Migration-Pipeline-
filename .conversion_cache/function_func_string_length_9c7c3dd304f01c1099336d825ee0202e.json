This is the most direct and efficient way to get the length of a string in C#.\n\n3.  **Null Handling**:\n    *   In C, passing a `NULL` pointer to `strlen` is undefined behavior and often leads to a crash. The C# code adds a `null` check (`if (str == null)`) to handle this case safely, returning `0`. This makes the C# version more robust.\n\n4.  **Logging**:\n    *   The `logger_log` function call is translated to a call to a static `Logger.Log` method. A placeholder `Logger` class and `LogLevel` enum are provided to make the example complete and demonstrate how such a call would be converted. In a real application, a standard logging framework would be used.", "explanation": "Successfully converted with Gemini", "warnings": [], "tokens_used": 1970, "processing_time": 17.623311519622803}
